# godot-xreal

English | [日本語](README_ja.md)

`godot-xreal` is a Godot 4 GDExtension (written in Rust with [godot-rust](https://godot-rust.github.io/))
that drives [XREAL](https://www.xreal.com/) glasses. It is a port of the Unity `com.xreal.xr` SDK
that reuses the SDK's **native** libraries instead of its Unity C# layer.

> **⚠️ Unofficial & experimental.** This is an independent community project — **not affiliated with,
> endorsed by, or supported by XREAL**. "XREAL" and the SDK are the property of their respective
> owners; the native libraries are **not** bundled — you vendor them yourself as a build prerequisite (see [Build](#build)).
> It works by reverse-engineering the vendored SDK's C ABI for interop — use at your own risk.

## Why a native port (not a C# translation)

The Unity SDK is a thin C# wrapper over Android `.so` libraries. Those libraries export a flat,
engine-agnostic C ABI (`libXREALNativeSessionManager.so` → `XREALGetHeadPoseAtTime`, …;
`libXREALXRPlugin.so` → 274 exports incl. an OpenXR-style compositor layer API). So instead of
translating C#, this extension `dlopen`s the libraries and feeds Godot directly. The obfuscated
lower NRSDK proc table (`libnr_api.so` / `NRGetProcAddr`) is avoided. ABI derivation:
[`docs/reference/reverse-engineering.md`](docs/reference/reverse-engineering.md); the RE'd functions and their
GDScript surface: [`docs/reference/native-api-reference.md`](docs/reference/native-api-reference.md).

## Platform

XREAL's native libraries ship for **Android arm64 only**, so this targets a **Godot Android app**
running on an XREAL-compatible host (phone / Beam) with glasses on USB-C. On desktop the extension
still loads (for scene editing) but head tracking is inert.

## Supported features

Verified on XREAL One Pro (and hand tracking on the XREAL Air 2 Ultra) with the **XREAL SDK for Unity
3.1.0** native libraries. Everything below is community-reverse-engineered interop, not an official API.

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Head tracking** (orientation: pitch / yaw / roll) | ✅ | From the XR-plugin display pose; drives the eye cameras. |
| **Tracking mode** 6DoF / 3DoF / 0DoF | ✅ | Selectable (`xreal/tracking_type` / `XrealSystem.set_tracking_type` / `debug.xreal.tracking_type`). |
| **Stereo glasses display** — head-locked peek window | ✅ | World-locked 3D through the glasses. **Multipass** (both eyes); it is the only stereo mode (no selector). |
| **Multiview** stereo | ❌ Shelved | Right eye is black — the NR compositor (`libnr_api`) can't import our client `GL_TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY`, and it gives no benefit on this two-SubViewport rig anyway. The code is kept but disabled; dev-only escape `setprop debug.xreal.force_multiview 1`. See `docs/archive/codex-righteye-analysis.md`. |
| **Recenter** | ✅ | Resets the forward direction (SDK `NativePerception::Recenter`). |
| **Hand tracking** (26-joint, both hands) → Godot `XRHandTracker` | ✅ (Air 2 Ultra) | Live hand joints fed to two `XRServer` hand trackers (`/user/hand_tracker/{left,right}`); the demo draws world-locked joint spheres. **Air 2 Ultra only** — the One Pro lacks the outward cameras (`IsHandTrackingSupported()==false`). Enabled via the internal `SetHandTrackingEnabled` + `input_source=3`. See [`docs/plans/hand-tracking-plan.md`](docs/plans/hand-tracking-plan.md). |
| **RGB camera** as a Godot `CameraFeed` | ✅ | Full-colour, shown in-scene on a head-locked quad. **Requires 3DoF** (it shares the camera with 6DoF SLAM). |
| **Render metrics** — present FPS / dropped / early / latency | ✅ | Live compositor stats via the `NRMetrics*` API (queried directly, not the Unity `UpdateMetrics` sink), on `XrealSystem` (`get_present_fps()`, `get_dropped_frame_count()`, …). See [`docs/plans/render-metrics-gdscript-plan.md`](docs/plans/render-metrics-gdscript-plan.md). |
| **Glasses input** — physical keys (MENU/MULTI: click/double/long) | ✅ | Godot signals (`key_event`, `key_state_changed`). |
| **Wear sensor / brightness / volume / electrochromic / USB hot-plug** | ✅ | Signals (`wearing_changed`, `brightness_changed`, `glasses_connected`, …). |
| **Diagnostics** — session / tracking state, HMD clock, plugin version | ✅ | Via `XrealSystem`. |
| **On-screen touch controller** (phone screen) | ✅ (demo) | App-level Godot UI (`demo/touch_controller.gd`): customizable touchpad + buttons → signals, phone-vibration haptics. The phone shows the controller, the glasses show the 3D scene (separate screens) — no native dependency. Godot analog of the SDK's `XREALVirtualController`. |
| **Phone 3D pointer** (host IMU) | ✅ (demo) | Tilt the phone to aim a 3D ray in the glasses (`demo/phone_pointer.gd`). Orientation is fused in GDScript from the NRController's raw IMU (`accel` → pitch/roll, `gyro` → yaw) exposed by `XrealSystem.poll_controller()` — the NRController *fused pose* and Godot's own `Input.get_gyroscope()` both read empty on this host. The ray raycasts to highlight what it hits and the trigger selects it; an on-screen left/right-hand toggle switches the beam origin; gyro drift is damped by bias-learning + a deadzone. `recenter` sets forward. |
| **Multi-resume** — glasses app keeps running (and rendering) when the phone switches apps | ✅ | **Where the Unity SDK uses a floating return window, this port implements auto-enter Picture-in-Picture instead.** Backgrounding drops the app to a small phone tile (paused-but-visible), so Godot's GL thread + Surface stay alive and the glasses keep showing live frames; tapping the tile returns to fullscreen. `XrealBridge.enableAutoEnterPiP`, driven from `demo/main.gd`; manifest scaffolding `nr_features=multiResume` + `NRFakeActivity`. **Device-verified**: the render submit counter keeps advancing past background (it froze before PiP). Why PiP rather than the floating window / a foreground service / a SurfaceView reparent: `docs/plans/background-render-plan.md`. (A floating return button was implemented first — it returned to the app but couldn't keep the glasses rendering — then removed in favour of PiP: `docs/archive/codex-floatingmanager-analysis.md`.) |
| **Plane detection** → GDScript | ✅ ported (on-device verify pending) | Horizontal/vertical plane detection via `XrealSystem.set_plane_detection_mode()` + `poll_planes()` (added/updated/removed with pose, size, alignment) + `get_plane_boundary()`. Flat C exports in `libXREALXRPlugin.so` (no extra AAR); needs 6DoF. All 4 AR features' C ABI is RE-confirmed — see [`docs/plans/ar-features-plan.md`](docs/plans/ar-features-plan.md). |
| **Spatial anchors** → GDScript | ✅ ported (on-device verify pending) | Create/persist/restore world anchors via `XrealSystem.acquire_anchor()` / `poll_anchors()` / `save_anchor()` / `load_anchor()` / `estimate_anchor_quality()` etc. Flat C exports (`XRTrackedAnchor` layout device-confirmed) + the vendored `nr_spatial_anchor.aar` backend; needs 6DoF. Also adds `is_camera_supported()` / `is_hmd_feature_supported()` — the SDK's per-device gate (the Air 2 Ultra has no RGB camera). |

Not implemented: 6DoF position for the app camera, image tracking, meshing, audio/photo capture.
(Image / mesh are portable without ARCore or AR Foundation and their C ABI is already RE'd — see
[`docs/plans/ar-features-plan.md`](docs/plans/ar-features-plan.md).)

## Build

The GDExtension is plain godot-rust; the one project-specific step is a **prerequisite** you do once —
vendoring the XREAL native libraries — before the Android export. Full command reference (desktop
iteration, manual `cargo ndk` / Gradle steps, signing): [`docs/guides/build-and-release.md`](docs/guides/build-and-release.md).

To open the project in a **desktop editor** without a missing-library error, build the do-nothing
desktop stubs once after cloning: `pwsh scripts/build_dummy_libs.ps1` (or
`./scripts/build_dummy_libs.sh`) — needs only clang + lld, cross-compiles every desktop target from
any host. The extension is Android-only, but Godot can't express that, so the `.gdextension` points
desktop platforms at these stubs ([`dummy/gdext_dummy.c`](dummy/gdext_dummy.c)); they register
nothing and are not committed.

### Prerequisite: vendor the XREAL runtime libraries

The XREAL native libraries are **not** included in this repo (they remain under XREAL's terms). Obtain
them from the **XREAL SDK for Unity** — the `com.xreal.xr` package, shipped as a tgz
(`com.xreal.xr.tar.gz`); **3.1.0 is the verified version**. Extract it (→ a `package/` directory)
and run:

```powershell
pwsh scripts/vendor_xreal_libs.ps1 -XrealPackage <…>/package
```

> **No terminal? Do it from the editor.** With the addon enabled, the **`XREAL Import`** dock (left
> panel) runs the same vendoring: click *パッケージを選択…*, pick `com.xreal.xr(.tgz|.tar.gz)` (or an
> extracted `package/` folder), and it extracts (via the system `tar`) and copies the same files into
> place. It vendors only the XREAL libs — the addon's own `libgodot_xreal.so` still comes from the
> `cargo ndk` build (or a prebuilt release).

The script (and the dock) stage everything the Android export needs (all destinations are git-ignored;
nothing is downloaded — you supply the package):

**3 core `.so` → `jniLibs/arm64-v8a/`** — copied from `Runtime/Plugins/Android/arm64-v8a/`; packed
next to the GDExtension via `godot_xreal.gdextension` `[dependencies]` and `dlopen`ed at startup:

| `.so` | Role |
|---|---|
| `libXREALNativeSessionManager.so` | session / head-pose C ABI |
| `libXREALXRPlugin.so` | XR-plugin compositor / display C ABI |
| `libVulkanSupport.so` | support lib the two above need |

**5 `.aar` → `addons/godot_xreal/android/`** — shipped into the APK by the addon's export plugin
(`export_plugin.gd`): the Java/JNI layer + manifest entries the glasses need. They also carry the
NR native libs (`jni/arm64-v8a/*.so`), which Gradle merges into the APK — so those are **not**
extracted separately. All copied from `Runtime/Plugins/Android/`:

| `.aar` | Role | Native libs delivered into the APK |
|---|---|---|
| `nr_loader.aar` | NR loader Java layer | `libnr_loader.so` |
| `nr_api.aar` | NR API Java layer | `libnr_api.so`, `libnr_plugin_6dof.so`, `libnr_rgb_camera.so` |
| `nr_common.aar` | NR common layer | `libnr_libusb.so` (plus QNN/SNPE libs) |
| `GlassesDisplayPlugEvent-2.4.2.aar` | glasses-detection `GlassesInitProvider` | — |
| `Log-Control-1.2.aar` | `LogControl` referenced by the above — **required**, or the app crashes before Godot starts | — |

**XrealBridge Java sources** — *not* vendored and *not* pre-compiled: the committed sources
(`addons/godot_xreal/android/src/`) are staged into the gradle build template by the addon's
export plugin and compiled by the export's Gradle run.

**Never copy `nractivitylife*.aar`** — its launcher is Unity-only and breaks a Godot app. (The
QNN/SNPE libs inside `nr_common.aar` are unused by this extension but ride into the APK with the
aar.)

### Build & install

With the toolchain on `PATH` (Rust `aarch64-linux-android` target, `cargo-ndk`, `ANDROID_NDK_HOME`, a
Godot 4.7-stable binary, `adb`), `scripts/build.sh` (or `scripts/build.ps1`) wraps the four Android
stages — cargo-ndk build → Godot APK export → `adb install` → launch. It re-checks the prerequisite
above first (both the 3 core `.so` and the addon's `.aar`/`.jar`) and prints the same guide if anything
is missing.

```bash
./scripts/build.sh --all      # build + export + install + run on the glasses
```

## Usage (MVP)

1. Vendor the libraries and build/deploy — see [Build](#build) above.
2. Instance `addons/godot_xreal/xreal_rig.tscn` (an `XrealHeadTracker` with a `Camera3D`
   child) into your scene, or add an `XrealHeadTracker` and parent a `Camera3D` yourself.
3. On device, the camera looks around with the wearer's head (3DoF).

The bundled `demo/main.tscn` does exactly this with a ring of boxes and an on-screen
status panel.

```
XrealHeadTracker (Node3D)   # rotation driven by native head pose
└── Camera3D                # current = true
```
